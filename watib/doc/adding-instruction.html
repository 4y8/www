  <h1>Adding an instruction</h1>
  <p>
    To add a plain instruction with a fixed number of parameters (which is the
    case of most instructions) which do not require any kind of type variables
    (such as <code>ref.as_non_null</code>), one needs to modify the following
    files:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code>Val/instruction-types.sch</code> to add the type of the
      instruction to the validation pass, </li>
    <li> <code>Asm/opcodes.sch</code> to add the opcode of the instruction, if
      the opcode depends on the argument it has to be added in an ad-hoc way to
      <code>Asm/binary.scm</code>.
  </ul>
  <p>
    The format in which all these additions have to be made is described in each
    file individually and the already present instructions serve as examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    For other instructions, the files <code>Val/validate.scm</code>
    and <code>Asm/binary.scm</code> will have to be modified, for validation and
    assembly. To replace the need of type variables, instructions can be
    validated by the <code>adhoc-instr</code> function of
    the <code>Val/validate.scm</code>. There they can rely on the stack for
    their validation. For instance, <code>ref.as_non_null</code> will be of
    type <code>(ref null ht) -> (ref ht)</code> where <code>ht</code> is the
    heap type corresponding to the reference type on top of the stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    The file `Ast/node.scm` should also be modified to record new kinds of
    instructions such as new blocks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each optimisation pass should be modified to take the new instructions into
    account (roughly everything in <code>Opt/</code>). Depending on the
    instruction and the pass their could be no necessary modification.
  </p>
