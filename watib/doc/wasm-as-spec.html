  <h1>Wasm-as' extensions to the specification</h1>
  <p>
    We try to list wasm-as' extensions to the spec, i.e. code modification made
    by wasm-as silently that do not appear specification. To our knowledge, this
    behaviours are not documented. The list is non-exhaustive. Feel free to
    contact us if you find anything missing.
  </p>
  <h2>Unreachable insertion</h2>
  <p>
    Wasm-as tend to replace dead code by <code>unreachable</code> and
    add <code>unreachable</code> after blocks that don't exit. While
    semantically preserving, this transformation can transform invalid code in
    valid code. For instance, the following function is not well-typed according
    to the spec. But wasm-as inserts an <code>unreachable</code> at the end,
    making it well-typed.
  </p>
  <pre>
(func (result i32)
  (if (i32.const 0)
    (then (return (i32.const 0)))
    (else (return (i32.const 0)))))</pre>

  <p>
    In the following piece of code, the <code>br</code> is not well-typed but
    wasm-as accepts it:
  </p>
  <pre>
(func
  (result i32)
  (block $l (result i32)
    (i32.const 0)
    (if
      (then (return (i32.const 0)))
      (else (return (i32.const 0))))
    (br $l)))</pre>
  <h2>Automatic function reference declaration</h2>

  <p>
    According to the specification, functions appearing in
    a <code>ref.func</code> have to appear outside the function bodies (in a
    global or in an elem section). Wasm-as puts all the undeclared function
    reference in an <code>elem declare func</code> section.
  </p>
  <h2>Sign extension insertion for packed get</h2>
  <p>
    According to the specification, when using <code>array.get</code>
    or <code>struct.get</code> on a packed field (<code>i8</code>
    or <code>i16</code>), a sign extension has to be specified. It means that
    either <code>.get_u</code> or <code>.get_s</code> has to be used. Wasm-as
    allows <code>.get</code> instructions on packed types, defaulting to
    unsigned.
